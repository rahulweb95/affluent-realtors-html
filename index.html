                    <p>Co-listing is a technique where you host other people’s
                        properties on Airbnb for a generous 20-30% cut on the
                        booking fee.</p>
                    <p>This technique attracts struggling landlords to you,
                        almost begging you to host their properties for them,
                        regardless of your experience.</p>

                            proprietary pricing strategy for you so all you have
                            to do is close a deal to the property owner
                            desperately in need of your help, and collect a % of
                            the booking fee so there are no legal complexities
                            to deal with.</li>
                        <li>Within 60 days you’ll start to see at least $3000 of
                            passive income and if you don’t, you don’t pay.</li>
